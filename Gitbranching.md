When the BCM receives the RESPONSE RF at 433.66 MHz, there's no associated change in CAN data for frame 0x2E7. As a result, there's no straightforward method to verify the RESPONSE RF using CAN data changes. If you require verification for RESPONSE RF, you might need to explore alternative methods or request additional functionalities, such as a new CAN ID that responds to the RESPONSE RF.
